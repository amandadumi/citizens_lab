    "Today we will learn how to use and collect data from the pH and the energy sensors. To get a feel for the sensors we will measure temperature in real time. We will first look at collecting and plotting the pH data between water and vinegar. Secondly, we will look at measuring the true voltage of a 9 volt battery. In the future, these probes will be used to characterize the microbial fuel cells you created."
