    "If a circle of radius $R$ is inscribed inside a square with side length $2R$,\n",
    "then the area of the circle will be $\\pi\\times R^2$ and the area of the square will be $(2R)^2$.\n",
    "So the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square will be $\\pi/4$.\n",
    "This means that, if you pick $N$ points at random inside the square,\n",

    "it is a rather slow method of calculating $\\pi$.\n",
    "To calculate each significant digit there will have to be about $10$ times as many trials as to\n",
